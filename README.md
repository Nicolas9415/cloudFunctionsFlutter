# cloudFunctionsFlutter
Thi is a simple project that uses some APIS from firebase such as Firebase cloud messaging and Cloud functions.

This was created in order to provide push notifications to an app made with flutter

It has a missig file called account.json, that has private information and thus is not included. This file can be downloaded from your own firebase project if wanted and use it with an existing app with the same project base.
